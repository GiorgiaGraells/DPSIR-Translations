# DPSIR-Translations

Global Change, driven predominantly by human activities, significantly alters Earth's systems, disrupting local ecosystems. Safe and just Earth System Boundaries (ESBs) aim to maintain Earth's resilience and minimize harm to humans. Effective intervention requires downscaling global change information to local levels, particularly for cities and businesses. This study will use the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, and Response) framework to analyze interactions between societal activities and environmental changes. A paired search of the literature will map key interactions within DPSIR components and ESBs. The research aims to highlight critical points influencing Global Change and identify links with actors in cities and businesses, guiding sustainable policy-making.
